      <p>HackOn is a participatory event happening in Amsterdam in mid-July on the ADM terrain. The event is centered around a critical view of how technology plays a role in society.</p>
      <p>HackOn was born out of the hacker ethics, decentralisation, autonomy, critical views, and lulz. However, we don't limit ourselves to just those topics. We decentralised by organising a smaller outdoor event in the Netherlands, this creates autonomy
        and a way to get other voices heard.
      </p>
      <p>HackOn is a non/anti-commercial event. Your crowdfunded ethical hacking startup can kindly go fuck itself.</p>
      <p>HackOn will not become an institution, we'd rather burn those down.</p>
      <p>HackOn is organised by anyone who is interested in contributing. It is an open invitation to participate in co-creating an environment where knowledge is shared and infrastructure is decentralised. There is space to organise workshops, debates,
        present your ideas or projects, and engage with other inhabitants of the event </p>
      <p><strong>By reserving for HackOn, you also agree to participate in the
 event. This could be by doing a (lightning)talk, workshop, debate,
performance, installation or $somethingawesome. Everyone is a volunteer.</strong></p><strong>
<p>SIGNUP IS NOW CLOSED!</p>
